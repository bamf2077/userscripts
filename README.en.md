# UserScripts

## Introduction

A bunch of handy user scripts with multiple purposes, applicable to userscript management browser extensions such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/ "Tampermonkey"), [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/ "Greasemonkey"). The scripts are written in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript "JavaScript | MDN") language.

### [SGCC Online University Assistant](https://github.com/francis-zhao/userscripts/blob/master/src/js/sgcc-online-university-assistant.user.js)

WTF? Do you have to learn online university again this year to earn points? Why don't you try the little assistant duck, just enter the employee's ERP number, it can automatically select and learn courses, even drop out of the courses that can't be hacked. Only one-click, enjoy yourself!

⚠ Attention：SGCC Online University (http://wldx.sgcc.com.cn) is a private corporation platform that only supports intranet access, please download the script to the certified intranet storage device and copy it to the intranet computer for installation.
